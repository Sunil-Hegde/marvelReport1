## API

Application Programming Interface, fancy way to describe a digital waiter which takes user's request to fetch some data from a website or server and then delivers it back to the user.(This is a very very simple explain but it still works).

I used NASA's Astronomy Photograph of the Day public API to practically implement whatever I learnt about APIs.
